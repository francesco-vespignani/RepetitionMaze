# Repetition Maze

Repository for Repetition Maze Experiment both born open-source (jsPsych on github) and born open-data (datapipe, osf).

##  Aim

todo

## Material

[Exp1 material](https://francesco-vespignani.github.io/RepetitionMaze/exp1_material/allitems.html)

##  Test the experiment

[https://francesco-vespignani.github.io/RepetitionMaze/run/?distr=pseudo&list=listB&casual=false&nrep=3&n=2&repo=test](https://francesco-vespignani.github.io/RepetitionMaze/run/?distr=pseudo&list=listB&casual=false&nrep=3&n=2&repo=test)

Available url parameters (if missing default will be used):

- id, id of the run. Default is null. If there is a stored data for a given id no data will be saved in osf. If null or absent (as in the link above) a random 10 char id will be generated by datapipe after the string "IDP" (id datapipe). If id is provided the "IDU" (id url param) string is added before the id in the osf filenames. This second oprion allows for linking the data with real person and anagraphic data;

- dist, type of distracters. Available values are nw (nonwords), pseudo (pseudowords), word (word salad), gramm (grammatical sentences). Default is nw.

- list, one of three lists. Available values ara listA listB listC, default a random list.

- casual, if items are presented randomly. Available values are true and false. Default is true.

- nrep, number of maze repetitions for each item. Available values are positive integers. Default is 5.

- n, number experimental items to make the experiment shoprter for testing. Available values are positive integers below 36. Default is null (all 36 items).

- repo, a switch for using different osf repositories (components). Default value is 'pilot', if you  provide any other string data will be stored in the test component  below.

For each run two files are saved, one with practice data  and one with experiment data, this allow to check how many subjects started the experiment without finishing it. No data is saved until the end of practice/experiment and data is never overwritten.
