# Repetion Maze Distractor Generator 

Repetition Maze Distractor Generator ‚Äì User Guide
What this app does

The Repetition Maze Distractor Generator allows you to create structured experimental datasets for psycholinguistic tasks where participants must choose between a real target word and a non-word distractor. For each word in a sentence, the app generates multiple distractor versions using controlled randomization, ensuring that the distractors are not real words.

**Key Features**

*1. Sentence Input*

You can generate trials from custom or preloaded sentences:

Enter any sentence in the "Enter a sentence" field and click "Add Sentence" to include it in the dataset.

Use the "Importa frasi SAND" button to load a set of predefined Italian sentences.

Upload a .txt file containing multiple sentences (separated by commas) using the "Carica file" input, then click "Importa frasi da file".

Each sentence is split into individual words (targets), and a row is generated for each one.

*2. Distractor Generation*

For each target word, the app automatically creates three distinct distractor versions: dist1, dist2, and dist3.

The distractor generator:

Counts the number of vowels and consonants in the original word.

Randomly samples the same number of vowels and consonants from the alphabet.

Shuffles them to form a non-word distractor.

Preserves capitalization if the original word starts with a capital letter.

Rejects any distractor that matches a real word listed in the provided lexicon (phi), ensuring all distractors are fake words.

*3. Side Assignment*

Each target-distractor pair is assigned a left/right side randomly for each version:

side1, side2, and side3 determine whether the target appears on the left (1) or right (0).

You can preview which distractor version to view using the dropdown selector ("Choose distractor version").

*4. Trial Preview*

The main panel includes a "Trial Presentation" area that visually simulates what a participant would see:

The target and distractor are shown on the left or right side of a central fixation point.

Use the "‚Üê Left" and "Right ‚Üí" buttons to scroll through trials.

*5. Dataset Management*

The app provides a dynamic and editable dataset table:

Each word from each sentence appears as a row, with its distractors and assigned sides.

You can edit values manually within the table.

Use the "Delete" button to remove all rows related to a specific sentence (by item number).

Use "Clear Dataset" to remove all data and start fresh.

*6. Download Results*

Once you are satisfied with the dataset, use the "Download Dataset" button to export your trials as a CSV file ready for use in experimental presentation software.

*7. Generation Info Panel*

Click "Info generation" to open an explanation panel describing:

How distractors are created and filtered.

How side assignment works for experimental layout purposes.

**Note**

The distractor generation logic filters out real words using a reference dictionary [Phoneitalia](https://github.com/stefanocoretta/phonItaliaR/blob/main/data/phonitalia.rda). However, due to the random nature of the letter combinations, manual review is always recommended before finalizing stimuli.
